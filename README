------------------------------

pialign is a package that allows you to create a phrase table and word alignments from an unaligned parallel corpus. First, configure and make the program:

$ ./configure
$ make

Then, to align a file, say we have a source language file "data/f.txt" and a target language file "data/e.txt", we can run the program as follows:

$ mkdir out
$ pialign data/f.txt data/e.txt out/align. &> out/log.txt &

The program will run for a while (about 1-2 hours for 10k sentences, or 10-20 hours for 100k). Note that by default, only sentences of 40 words or less will be aligned. This can be changed by using "-maxsentlen XX" where XX is the maximum sentence length, but if this is set to a large value the program may use a large amount of memory, and the speed will drop to some extent.

When the program is done running, it will output two files "out/align.1.samp" and "out/align.1.pt." align.1.samp contains the alignments (in the form of trees) created by the aligner, and align.1.pt contains a phrase table that can be used with Moses.

---------- FAQ --------------
-----------------------------

Q: I want to create word alignments.

A: This can be done by running the script "script/itgstats.pl" on "align.1.samp." There are three types of word alignments that you can create, many-to-many (phrase) alignments, one-to-many (block) alignments, and one-to-one (word) alignments.

  many-to-many: $ script/itgstats.pl palign < out/align.1.samp > out/align.1.pal
  one-to-many:  $ script/itgstats.pl balign < out/align.1.samp > out/align.1.bal
  one-to-one:   $ script/itgstats.pl align < out/align.1.samp > out/align.1.wal

If you want to visualize these alignments you can do so as follows:

  $ script/visualize.pl data/e.txt data/f.txt out/align.1.pal > out/align.1.vis

~~~

Q: I want lexical reordering probabilities for Moses.

A: Run the "itgstats.pl" script on the derivation file. Here, "7" is the maximum length of a phrase, and 0.5 is the "pseudo-count" to be added for smoothing.

  $ script/itgstats.pl lex 7 0.5 < out/align.1.samp | LC_ALL=C sort > out/align.1.lex

  These are bi-directional mono/inv/other probabilities.

~~~

Q: What are the scores in the phrase table?

A: These are explained in detail in the referenced paper, but briefly:

   1,2: The conditional probabilities of the phrases p_t(e|f), p_t(f|e)
   3: The joint probability of the phrase pair p_t(e,f)
   4: The average posterior probability of a span containing e,f
   5,6: Lexical weighting probabilities using model 1 word probabilities
        (only output if the base measure uses model 1)
   7: The uniform phrase penalty

~~~

Q: What is the format of the derivation tree in the .samp file?

A: The bracketed representation in the derivation file has four different types of brackets:

   [X Y]: Indicates that children X and Y were generated by a regular ITG symbol
   <X Y>: Indicates that children X and Y were generated by a reverse ITG symbol
   ((( e ||| f ))): Indicates a phrase pair e, f
   { X }: Indicates that X was generated as a single phrase in the model. Words
          inside these brackets were actually aligned together as a single
          phrase, but by default pialign forces alignments down to words to
          preserve word alignments for possible other uses.

~~~

Q: pialign is too slow!

A: If you want a speed up at the possible small drop in alignment accuracy, you can reduce the size of the probability beam using the -probwidth option. The default is "-probwidth 1e-10" so if you set this to "-probwidth 1e-08" instead, you will likely see a significant speed up. We are also currently working on parallelization or other ways to speed up the alignment process.

~~~

Q: There is no "configure" file to build the program.

A: If you checked the source directly out from the repository, you may have to run autotools before building. First, make sure autotools is installed on your computer, then run "autoreconf -i" which will prepare the configure file for you.

--------- Options -----------
-----------------------------

~~~ Input/Output ~~~

Usage: pialign [OPTIONS] FFILE EFILE PREFIX

 FFILE is the foreign (source) input corpus
 EFILE is the english (target) input corpus
 PREFIX is the prefix that will be used for the output

Other input:
 -le2f         A file containing the lexicon probabilities for e2f
 -lf2e         A file containing the lexicon probabilities for f2e
               (These can be used with "-base m1" or "-base m1g" but are not necessary)

~~~ Model Parameters ~~~

 -model        Model type (hier/len/flat, default: hier)

 -avgphraselen A parameter indicating the expected length of a phrase.
               default is small (0.01) to prevent overly long alignments
 -base         The type of base measure to use (m1g is generally best).
               'm1g'=geometric mean of model 1, 'm1'=arithmetic mean of model 1,
               'uni'=simple unigrams (default 'm1g')
 -defstren     Fixed strength of the PY process (default none)
 -defdisc      Fixed discount of the PY process (default none)
 -nullprob     The probability of a null alignment (default 0.01)
 -noremnull    Do not remember nulls in the phrase table
 -termprior    The prior probability of generating a terminal (0.33)
 -termstren    Strength of the type distribution (default 1)

~~~ Phrase Table ~~~

 -maxphraselen The maximum length of a minimal phrase (default 7)
 -maxsentlen   The maximum length of sentences to be used (default 40)
 -printmax     The maximum length of phrases included in the phrase table (default 7)
 -printmin     The minimal length of phrases included in the phrase table (default 1)
 -noword       Output only phrase alignments (do not force output of word alignments)

~~~ Inference Parameters ~~~

 -burnin       The number of burn-in iterations (default 9)
 -histwidth    The width of the histogram pruning to use (default none)
 -probwidth    The width of the probability beam to use (default 1e-10)

 -samprate     Take samples every samprate turns (default 1)
 -worditers    The number of iterations to perform with a word-based model (default 0)


-----------------------------
---------- Misc. ------------
-----------------------------

If you have boost installed, uncomment the lines at the beginning of the Makefile to include boost libraries, and uncomment "#define COMPRESS" at the beginning of definitions.h. This will make the program automatically compress the output in .gz format.

-----------------------------
---------- TODO -------------
-----------------------------

* Increase the efficiency of Model 1 calculation.
* Reduce the memory used by the phrase table by representing phrases as references to their position in the corpus (like a suffix array).
* Distributed sampling to allow for training on larger data sets.
